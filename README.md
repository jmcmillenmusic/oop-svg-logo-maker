# OOP-SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

As a web developer, it's important that I am able to put my best foot forward online and have a strong virtual presence. One way to do this is to be able to create a professional logo by crafting the tools needed to create a logo that will stand out to potential employers. Because of this, I have created an SVG Logo Maker to assist with the creation of basic logos.
